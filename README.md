# Helicopter Prison Break

In this mini-project, I use python to extract data from the Wikipedia web page on the [list of helicopter prison escapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes#Actual_attempts) that has been attempted over the years. 

The goal was to identify:

1. Which country had the highest occurrence of prison breaks by means of helicopter

2. Which year saw the greatest number of prison break attempts by means of helicopter

This project was completed in Python JupyterNotebook and the ipynb file can be found [here](https://github.com/tlieva/prison-break-mini-project/blob/f09fa18dd2ba5f035895a124dc18ded2927edc97/prison-breaks.ipynb).
