# Helicopter Prison Break

In this mini-project, I use python to extract data from the Wikipedia web page on the [list of helicopter prison escapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes#Actual_attempts) that has been attempted over the years. 

The two objectves for this project was to identify:

1. **the country with the highest occurrence of prison break by means of helicopter**
2. **the year saw which saw the greatest number of prison break attempts by means of helicopter**

This project was completed in Python JupyterNotebook and the ipynb file can be found [here](https://github.com/tlieva/prison-break-mini-project/blob/f09fa18dd2ba5f035895a124dc18ded2927edc97/prison-breaks.ipynb).
